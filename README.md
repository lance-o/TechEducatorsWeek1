# Requirments Met:

I'd like to preface this with a small note: I have no idea what exactly the specific requirements are.

### Correct use of HTML semantics, such as header, footer and nav.

### Correctly overlayed text

### Absolute positioning used for the overlayed text

### Flexbox usage

### Image elements and pathing

# Required not met

I'm relatively certain I've gotten everything. One caveat I had while making the site was the margin of the body tag. Didn't know exactly what had the margin so I just brute-forced it and tried everything.

Maybe a note about it in the lesson? It's a very tiny fix but it's also very hidden.

If I did miss anything/Wasn't meant to leave the workshop settings for flex, etc, then I'll take full responsibility for that. Do tell me what I got wrong or could do better within the scope of what's been taught, though - thanks!
